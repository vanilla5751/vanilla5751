- I’m interested in ... math, science, coding, baking, my little pony.
- I’m looking to collaborate on ... no collaborations at the moment
- My discord is vanilla5751

I know advanced mathematics like calculus, differential equations, vector analysis, real and complex analysis, linear algebra, mathematical logic, hyperbolic geometry, and many more topics.

I am trying to pursue a doctoral degree in theoretical physics at ETH Zurich Switzerland.
